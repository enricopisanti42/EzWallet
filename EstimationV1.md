# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size

|                               | Estimate                                  |                   
 | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------
| NC (Estimated number of classes to be developed)        | 1 classes for database connection         | 
|                               | 3 classes for database models             |
|                               | 1 classes for api routes                  |
|                               | 1 classes for application context         |
|                               | 4 classes for application authentication  |
|                               | 6 classes for application controller      |
|                               | 2 classes for appplication users          |
|                               | 9 classes for tests                       |       
|                               | 10 classes for GUI                         |        
| A (Estimated average size per class)    | 30 LOC per class                          | 
| S (Estimated size of project)           | NC * A=37*30=1110 (LOC)                   |
| E (Estimated effort, in person hours, here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  | S / P=1110/10=111 (person hour)           |
| C (Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro))| E * C= 111*30=3330(euro)               |  
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week)     | E / (T * H * D)=111*4/(4*8*5)= 3(weeks) |

| Component name        | Estimated effort  |             
| --------------------- | ----------------- | 
| Requirement document  | 35 person hour    |
| GUI prototype         | 70 person hour    |
| Design document       | 35 person hour    |
| Code                  | 175 person hour    |
| Unit tests            | 53 person hour    |
| Api tests             | 53 person hour    |
| Management documents  | 35 person hour    |
| --------------------- | ----------------- |
| Total                 | 456 person hour   |



# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|Review existing systems|56|

|Model process|48|
|Identify user requirements|48|
|Identify performance requirements|48|
|Identify interface requirements|48|
|Prepare software requirements specification|72|
|Software requirements review|56|

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |444| 111
| estimate by product decomposition |456| 114
| estimate by activity decomposition |432| 108
