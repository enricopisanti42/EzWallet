# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWallet  project in CURRENT version (as received by the teachers), assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size

| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------
| NC (Number of classes)        | 1 classes for database connection         | 
|                               | 3 classes for database models             |
|                               | 1 classes for api routes                  |
|                               | 1 classes for application context         |
|                               | 4 classes for application authentication  |
|                               | 6 classes for application controller      |
|                               | 2 classes for appplication users          |
|                               | 9 classes for tests                       |       
|                               | X classes for GUI                         |        
| A (Average size per class)    | 30 LOC per class                          | 
| S (Size of project)           | NC * A            (LOC)                   |
| E (Effort)                    | S / P             (person hour)           | P = productivity of 10 LOC per person hour  
| C (Estimated cost)            | E * C             (euro)                  | C = cost of 30 euro per person hour   
| Estimated calendar time       | E / (T * H * D)   (weeks)                 | T = team of 4 people, H = 8 hours per day, D = 5 days per week

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference
